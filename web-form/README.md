# Prevention Filter Web Form
To deploy the web-based version of the `ceo-filter-gen.sh` script, rewritten in JavaScript, simply copy/paste the "public" folder to the root or subdirectory of your website.

This web form is written in ReactJS so the page is very _reactive_ to the user input, _as keys are entered_.
